# tv-script-generation
The objective of this project was to use deep learning techniques to generate script for the next season of Seinfield. We had data from 9 previous seasons of Seinfield which was used to generate the script for each character based on the character name that is provided by the user. I used LSTM model to generate next word based on the previous words used.
This project was part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree course.

Files Included:

- dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb - File containing all the code for cleaning and generating script from Seinfield text
- Create_tar_file.ipynb - Methods for creting a tar file
- helper.py - Contains functions used for saving and loading models 
- generated_script.txt - Example of generated script for character named 'Elaine'
